# JSON_Comparison

 Objective: Develop a user-friendly Python tool using Tkinter to compare JSON files based on API call 
responses, enabling users to identify differences between yesterday's and today's data.


Methodology:
  1. Download and Save JSON Files: Implement functionality to download and save JSON files 
     locally, which are obtained from API calls.
  2.  User Input and File Selection: Allow users to input a Tariff identification number to fetch the 
      list of JSON files saved in the corresponding folder and provide a dropdown box for users to select the JSON file for comparison.
