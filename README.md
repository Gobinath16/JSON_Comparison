# JSON_Comparison

 Objective: Develop a user-friendly Python tool using Tkinter to compare JSON files based on API call 
responses, enabling users to identify differences between yesterday's and today's data.
Methodology:
o Download and Save JSON Files: Implement functionality to download and save JSON files 
locally, which are obtained from API calls (like Project 2).
o User Input and File Selection: Allow users to input a Tariff identification number to fetch the 
list of JSON files saved in the corresponding folder and provide a dropdown box for users to 
select the JSON file for comparison.
o Comparison Process: Develop algorithms to compare yesterday's and today's JSON files and 
highlight the differences between the files using color-coded annotations (e.g., red for 
deletions, green for additions).
o PyQt5 GUI Development: Design a split-screen interface using Tkinter to display the JSON 
files side by side. Created a "Compare" button to initiate the comparison process and display 
the results â€“ used prompt engineering principles.
o Data Presentation: Utilize data visualization techniques, such as JSON compare and data Frame 
formatting, to present the comparison results in a structured and user-friendly format
